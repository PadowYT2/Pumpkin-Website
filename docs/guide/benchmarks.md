# Benchmarks

Here, common Minecraft servers are compared against Pumpkin.

> [!CAUTION]
> **This comparison is unfair.** Pumpkin currently has far fewer features than other servers, which might suggest it uses fewer resources.
> It's also important to consider that other servers have had years for optimization.
> Vanilla forks, which donâ€™t need to rewrite the entire vanilla logic, can focus exclusively on optimizations.
